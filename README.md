I'm Isaac Vianna! 

I'm a software engineer with experience in front-end, full-stack, and mobile development. I hold a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering from Anhanguera University. I have been working in technology since 2018, primarily as a front-end developer in various companies. However, I have worked as a full-stack web developer (using React, Svelte, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails), a mobile developer (using native technologies and Flutter), and occasionally as a software architect.

I have a strong background in services, which gives me a user-focused and excellence-driven perspective. I have gained a wide range of skills and expertise throughout my career. I am always seeking to improve my abilities and stay updated with the latest market trends.

I am committed to delivering high-quality projects, prioritizing client satisfaction, and creating exceptional user experiences. If you are looking for a versatile, experienced professional who is passionate about technology, I am ready to contribute my knowledge and skills. Let's work together to achieve outstanding results!
